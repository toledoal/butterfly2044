## Buterfly Project

# A Sample Ethereum Dapp using React, Web3, Truffle and the Rinkeby Network

This project was part of the HatchCrypto Blockchain specialization program. (Class April 2018)

You may use the D-app here https://toledoal.github.io/butterfly2044/index.html (You need to be connected to the Rinkeby Network and have Ether to test)

## Current Issues

The Dapp needs to be tested. 

The Dapp needs loaders and changing states in the UI (So when you perform a transaction the User knows what is going on)

## Development Process





## Wireframes

Before development I created a rough set of wireframes.
